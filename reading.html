            <blockquote>There no such thing as a child<br>

            <p>During my free time, I will spend my time reading. In my opinion, books are like<br>
              a portal to me to travel across the world that I want to go to. Out of all the<br>
              books that I have read, one of my favourite book is <i>Koc 13</i> by <i>Naim Tamdjis.</i><br>
              The novel tells the story of Raiqal, a mysterious traveller and Aiman ​​Aklaken, an <br>
              international bestselling horror writer who travel to the realm of fantasy by boarding<br>
              Coach 13 that appears once every four years at an Dabong Railway Station. In the adventure,<br>
               they have met Raihan who has been trapped in that world for 4 years. Together, they need to<br>
               work as a team to get out of that world and complete all the tasks given at each stop. They<br>
               had to perform tasks in the cemetery, save themselves from zombies, fight robots from the future,<br>
               and other yet ridiculous tasks.<br></p>
            <p>In my opinion, the storytelling of this novel is quite relaxed and the insertion of funny scenes<br>
              liven up the movement of the story. That is indeed the advantage of the writer, Naim Tamdjis since<br>
              he wisely controls the story plot. For the ending, although maybe not as smooth as the train stops,<br>
              but it leave a lot of feeling to the reader.<br></p>
