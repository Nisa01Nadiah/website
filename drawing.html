            <blockquote>I started painting as a hobby when I was a little.<br> 
                I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest.<br> 
                Anybody can do what I do.<br>
                ~ Bob Ross</blockquote><br> 
            <p>One of my favourite hobbies is drawing. With drawing, I can express my<br>
                feelings and paint everything that I want on my canvas. Drawing also is<br>
                my therapy and makes me feel more creative since I have no rules on how to<br>
                create art. When drawing, I will find inspiration from my surroundings.<br>
                I also find inspiration from Pinterest, Instagram and TikTok. To create a<br>
                new art, I will take a few hours to a month to finish it. Even though it is<br>
                not pretty in my eyes, at least I feel that I can improve my drawing skills<br>
                that give me hope to create a masterpiece in the future.<br>
