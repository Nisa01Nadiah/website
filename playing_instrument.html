            <blockquote>Learning a musical instrument is challenging, it demands fine motor skills and coordination.<br> 
              It develops children's listening, thinking skills, imagination and perseverance.<br>
              It brings out the very best in the children as they work collaboratively with their peers and teachers.<br>

            <p>Other than drawing and reading, I also like to play instruments. If I need to<br>
              recommend someone to learn instrument, I will ask them to learn playing<br>
              kalimba because it is beginner friendly. Kalimba also helps me to relax and<br>
              de-stress. It also soothes my mind and calms me with its beautiful melodies and<br>
              calming sounds.  Sometimes, I'm creating my own kalimba tabs from a piano sheet<br>
              because I cannot find any music cover  that uses Kalimba on YouTube. I also learn<br>
              to play kalimba so I can cover my favourite song. In the future, I hope I can cover<br>
              as many songs as possible and teach others to play kalimba to make them feel that<br>
              learning instruments is easy and fun.<br></p>
