            <blockquote>"Language is not a genetic gift, it is a social gift.<br>
              Learning a new language is becoming a member of the club â€“ the community of speakers of that language.".<br>
              ~ Frank Smith</blockquote><br> 
            <p>I am also learning another language as a hobby. For choosing my target<br>
              language, I choose to learn Korean because I love to watch Korean dramas<br>
              and Korean variety shows in my free time. Because of that, I choose to learn<br>
              Korean to watch any Korean drama that I want without waiting for the subtitles<br>
              to come out. Also, learning another language can break the language barrier that<br>
              can make me able to speak with native speakers.Furthermore, learning a new language<br>
              means that I will be able to read more books and memes. Even though my Korean is still<br>
              weak, I will learn harder <del>so I can talk with my Korean oppa</del> until I am able<br>
              to hold a conversation with others.</p>
